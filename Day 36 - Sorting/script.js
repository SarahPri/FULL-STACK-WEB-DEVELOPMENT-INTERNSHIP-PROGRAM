// Question 1: Sort the given array arr = [26, 42, 78, 18, 3] using Bubble sort.


//Sorting
const arr = [26, 42, 78, 18, 3]
function bubbleSort(array){
    //Get the length of the array
    let n = array.length;

    //Outer loop to make sure we go through the array as many times as needed
    for(let i = 0; i<n-1; i++){
        //Inner loop to go through the array and compare adjacent items
        for(let j=0; j<n-1; j++){
            
        }
    }
}
